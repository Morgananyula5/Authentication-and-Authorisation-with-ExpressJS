# delete.js

## Overview

This file provides functionality for deleting a user in a web application. It includes both frontend and backend components, combined into a single JavaScript file for demonstration purposes.

### Frontend Interaction

The frontend part of the code handles user input and sends a request to the backend to delete a user. It listens for the form submission event, prevents the default form action, and sends a POST request to the backend API with the username to be deleted.

### Backend Route Handler

The backend part of the code manages the actual user deletion process. It includes authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform the deletion. The backend logic is included in the same file for illustrative purposes, but in a real application, this would be separated into server-side code.

### Code

Here is the combined JavaScript code that includes both the frontend and backend logic:

```javascript
// Frontend interaction: Handling form submission
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    document.getElementById("delete-user-form").addEventListener("submit", async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const username = document.getElementById("other-username").value;

        try {
            const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4001/auth/delete/user`, {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json"
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({ username })
            });

            const result = await response.json();
            alert(result.message);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error deleting user:", error);
            alert("An error occurred while deleting the user.");
        }
    });
});

// Backend route handler (for demonstration, assume this script is run on the server)
// The following code is just an illustration and won't work directly in a client-side JS file
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const UserModel = require('./models/UserModel'); // Adjust path as necessary

app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Authentication and authorization middlewares
const authentication = (req, res, next) => {
    // Authentication logic
    next();
};

const authorization = (options) => (req, res, next) => {
    // Authorization logic based on options
    next();
};

// Route to handle user deletion
app.post('/auth/delete/user', authentication, authorization({ isAdmin: false }), async (req, res) => {
    const { username } = req.body;

    try {
        // Check if the user exists
        const user = await UserModel.findOne({ where: { username } });
        if (!user) {
            return res.status(404).json({ message: "User not found" });
        }

        // Delete the user
        await UserModel.destroy({
            where: { username }
        });

        return res.status(200).json({ message: `User ${username} deleted successfully` });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return res.status(500).json({ message: "An error occurred while deleting the user" });
    }
});

// Start the server (for demonstration purposes)
const port = 4001;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
