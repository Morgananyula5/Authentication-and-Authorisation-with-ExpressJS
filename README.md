## Challenge Overview

### Step 1: Implement the Delete User Functionality

**Backend Implementation**

- **File:** `deleteUser.js`

  ```javascript
  // Backend route handler (for demonstration, assume this script is run on the server)
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
  const UserModel = require('./models/UserModel'); // Adjust path as necessary

  app.use(bodyParser.json());

  // Authentication and authorization middlewares
  const authentication = (req, res, next) => {
      // Authentication logic
      next();
  };

  const authorization = (options) => (req, res, next) => {
      // Authorization logic based on options
      next();
  };

  // Route to handle user deletion
  app.post('/auth/delete/user', authentication, authorization({ isAdmin: false }), async (req, res) => {
      const { username } = req.body;

      try {
          // Check if the user exists
          const user = await UserModel.findOne({ where: { username } });
          if (!user) {
              return res.status(404).json({ message: "User not found" });
          }

          // Delete the user
          await UserModel.destroy({
              where: { username }
          });

          return res.status(200).json({ message: `User ${username} deleted successfully` });
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
          return res.status(500).json({ message: "An error occurred while deleting the user" });
      }
  });

  // Start the server (for demonstration purposes)
  const port = 4001;
  app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
  ```

**Frontend Implementation**

- **File:** `delete.js`

  ```javascript
  // Frontend interaction: Handling form submission
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      document.getElementById("delete-user-form").addEventListener("submit", async (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          const username = document.getElementById("other-username").value;

          try {
              const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4001/auth/delete/user`, {
                  method: "POST",
                  headers: {
                      "Content-Type": "application/json"
                  },
                  body: JSON.stringify({ username })
              });

              const result = await response.json();
              alert(result.message);
          } catch (error) {
              console.error("Error deleting user:", error);
              alert("An error occurred while deleting the user.");
          }
      });
  });
  ```

### Step 2: Analysis of the Requirement

**Requirement:** “This delete user functionality can be done after authentication.”

**Explanation:**

Requiring authentication for user deletion is generally a good practice. Authentication ensures that only users who have logged in can access certain functionalities, which helps prevent unauthorized access. However, it's essential to combine authentication with authorization to ensure that the authenticated user has the appropriate permissions to perform the delete operation. For example, a regular user should not be able to delete other users' accounts, while an admin might.

**Authentication vs. Authorization:**

- **Authentication** verifies who the user is (e.g., through login credentials). It confirms that the user is who they claim to be.

- **Authorization** determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do (e.g., whether they can delete a user or not). It checks the user's permissions and roles.
